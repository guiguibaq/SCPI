# SCPI
SCPI are financial instruments, open to retail investors in France, that enable investing in real estate companies. Their benefit is an access to real estate markets at a much lower entry ticket than buying real estate directly.

There are hundreeds of possible SCPI choices. Which one is best?

In particular I'm comparing along two dimenssions:
- which company is best
- which investment option ("en direct" or "en demembrement")
